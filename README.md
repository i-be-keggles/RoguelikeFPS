# RoguelikeFPS

This is a project I've been working on to learn the game development workflow with the Unity Engine. Everything present in the project was built from scratch, and being able to fully branch out into the artistic side of things, such as modelling and texturing, was a wonderful experience.

This project is nearing the end of its completion and was never meant to be published. It may get revisited in the future, but is left public to document my learning and potentially provide a source of inspiration for the fellow aspiring game dev.
